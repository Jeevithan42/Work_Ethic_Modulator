# Work_Ethic_Modulator
This is an app where you can set a timer for how long you want to work and how long of a break you want. Then every time your work portion runs out, you will receive a message, where you can either start the break timer and take a break, or you can bank it and save it up and take an extra long break next time around. This app I created to motivate myself to work more efficiently and have a way of timing it. This can also be used for workouts and used to do a timed effort with a timed rest.

USE:
To use, simply enter ho wlong you want to work in the top in hrs/secs/mins then in the bottom enter howlong you want to rest for in minutes, then press Set Times and It will all be taken care of. Note: There is no countdown for the rest timer
